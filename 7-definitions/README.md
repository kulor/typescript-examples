Definitions
===================

Definition files are for explaining the structure of a non-typescript JavaScript file. Many examples out there of large frameworks like JQuery, Backbone, AngularJS etc.

This also offers you a low cost of effort to expose to TypeScript the APIs of your existing JS without having to do a extensive rewrite.
