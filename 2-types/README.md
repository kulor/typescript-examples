Types
===================

The first big win you can gain from TypeScript is declaring types on your variables, function returns and arguments.

This gives the compiler more information to inform you when you are trying to do silly things like `{some:'object'} + 'foo'`.

If your IDE supports TypeScript it will give you RedSquigglesâ„¢ for the above example.
