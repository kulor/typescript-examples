Typescript Examples
===================

Some simple examples of what TypeScript can bring to the table.

Created with the intention of demonstrating interesting parts of the language to dev folks at [moo.com](http://moo.com).


What is TypeScript
------------------

TypeScript is a language for application scale JavaScript development

It is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript for all browsers and environments.
